# Chess-AI
Chess engine using stockfish 14
The aim of this project is to create an artificial intelligence that can play chess and analyse how it has improved with the different iterations of the engine. To achieve this
goal different approaches to chess engines will be explored. These different algorithms will be implemented into Python with the aim of creating a low to mid-level
chess engine.
